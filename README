build-pkg quick tutorial
========================

Setup
-----

Run (the name of the directory doesn't matter; it's easier to keep track of multiple opam
base dirs when they're named after the switches used to set them up)

server/build_pkg_server.exe serve -port 54321 -base-dir /tmp/opam.4.02.3

This will prepare the server for setup in some_dir. To actually set the server up and prepare
it for incoming requests, run 

client/build_pkg.exe setup -host localhost -port 54321 -opam-switch 4.02.3

Note that in some conditions passing an invalid switch may take a long time before failing.


Building
--------

After the server has been set up, one can build packages using

client/build_pkg.exe build -host localhost -port 54321 -checksum-file /tmp/checksum.md5 ../repos/core_kernel

The checksum file is the file to which the checksum of all the build artifacts will be written to,
and the anonymous argument is the path to a public-release repo -- the client expects to find there
two files: .metadata.sexp and dist.tar.gz.

If the build fails, the client will show last n (= 20) lines of the raw output of the commands it ran
(most importantly - make). The file names and line numbers will be converted so that they correspond
to files in jane/.

Logs
----

In <base_dir>/build/log are logs for every build separately (<package_name>.log) and one for all builds
(all.log).

Old logs are stored in <base_dir>/build/log/old.


Limitations
-----------


If you start a server in an opam base dir and run jenga, she(?) will not rerun builds for packages
which have already been built. This means that the server will return errors, as it won't find
dependencies for that package.
